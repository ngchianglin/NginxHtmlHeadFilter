# Nginx Html Head Filter 
A Simple Nginx Response Body Filter Module

## Introduction
The repository contains an Nginx Resonse Body Filter Module that will filter a HTTP response and insert a specific text string
after the html &lt;head&gt; tag. For example, it can insert a monitoring javascript after the &lt;head&gt; tag.

The filter module can be used together with Nginx proxy_pass, to insert text string into HTTP responses from an upstream web server. The module will process HTTP 200 OK responses where the content type is text/html. If the content from the upstream server is compressed (gzip, deflate etc...), it will not be modified. There is also a check on the content length, if it exceeds 10 MiB (10 x 1024 x 1024), the content will not be processed. 

Take note that dynamic content generated by scripts may not have content length set. This 10 MiB will not apply for such content.

The &lt;head&gt; tag must appear within the first 128 characters of the HTTP response, otherwise the response will not be modified. 


Refer to the Further Details below for more information on how the module is implemented and how it can be used.

## Module Directives
The module takes 2 directives that can be configured in the Nginx 's location context. 

**html_head_filter**  

* syntax: html_head_filter [text string]
* default: none
* context: Location

This directive enables the html head filter module. The argument "text string" will be inserted after the first &lt;head&gt; tag in the HTTP response body.  


**html_head_filter_block** 

* syntax: html_head_filter_bloc [on/off]
* default: off
* context: location

This is an optional directive. If it is set to on, the module will display a blank html page if the &lt;head&gt; tag is not found within the first 128 characters of a HTTP response. By default, this directive is off. 
When this directive is off, the HTTP response will not be modified if the &lt;head&gt; tag is not within the first 128 characters.

## Example Configuration

An example showing the insertion of a mymonitor1.js script after the &lt;head&gt; tag of html content. In this case, nginx is configured as a reverse proxy to a backend service running on localhost at port 8080. 

        location / {

            index  index.html index.htm;

            proxy_set_header HOST $host;
            proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
            proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
            proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;

            html_head_filter "<script src=\"mymonitor1.js\"></script>";
            html_head_filter_block on;

        }

## Compiling and Installation
The module works with the latest stable version of [Nginx 1.18.0](https://nginx.org/download/). 
Download the latest stable version of Nginx and its corresponding pgp signature.  Verify the signature of the downloaded tarball. 
Refer to [Nginx website](https://nginx.org/en/pgp_keys.html) for the public signing keys that can be used to verify the signature. 
Extract the nginx source tarball if the signature verification is ok. 

To obtain a copy of the Filter Module. 

    git clone https://github.com/ngchianglin/NginxHtmlHeadFilter.git
    
Refer to the Source signature section below for instructions on verifying the module 's signature. 

To compile the module statically into nginx. The following configure option can be used.  

    --add-module=<Path to>/NginxHtmlHeadFilter 

For example, the following commands can be used to compile the module and install nginx into **/usr/local/nginx**
Note: These example commands do not include signature verification of the downloaded packages. 
For security, do verify the signatures of the downloads. 

    git clone https://github.com/ngchianglin/NginxHtmlHeadFilter.git
    wget https://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.18.0.tar.gz
    tar -zxvf nginx-1.18.0.tar.gz
    cd nginx-1.18.0
    ./configure --with-cc-opt="-Wextra -Wformat -Wformat-security -Wformat-y2k -fPIE -O2 -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2 -fstack-protector-all" --with-ld-opt="-pie -Wl,-z,relro -Wl,-z,now -Wl,--strip-all"  --add-module=../NginxHtmlHeadFilter
    make
    sudo make install
